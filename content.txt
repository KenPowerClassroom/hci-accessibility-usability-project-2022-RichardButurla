What is this report about? This report is about the accesibility of blackboard in terms of usability heuristics. 
Blackboard is a website used by schools and colleges to help improve college life for both lecturers/teachers and students.
On blackboard you can check many things. You can check Posts, Updates on events like returned assignments, Your marks in a module/subject, and a calender.
We will soon see all the positives and negatives and investigate this website in terms of usability and heuristics.

Usability Assessment:
1)Consistency: Blackboard has a consistency of color. It awlays has white,black,gray and blue colors.
The layout of the website always looks like white board or page, ironic since it is named blackboard.(this is a heuristic too).
The layout of a white background and boxes with blue headings is consistent. The blue color indicating you are about to travel to a more information concentrated page.
When you do click on a blue header on the home page, you are sent to that subjects in depth info. The headings of anything to do with the subject like assessments and labs,
are now in a black box with gray/white text. There are white boxes with "To Do" or "Whats New" headings and blue headings again to go more in depth in those boxes.
Once you click on one of the headers inside the black box, you then are met with a simple scroll down page of information. 
The website is always consistent with its colors, prompts, menus, boxes and layout.
