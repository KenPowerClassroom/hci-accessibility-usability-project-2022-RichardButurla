        <h1> Summary/Conclusion</h1>

        <h2>I have learned alot about blackboard during this project. The operation and design are some to name as i realised how much lecturers affect
            the experience for a student user, whether that be for good or bad. Lecturers have quite some control over the students pages by just adding different
            headings or simpoly choosing to place information in places that may or may not be accessible to the student. The website could be improved by increasing
            visibility, colors or sizes of items on the website. It also may need better error prevention for both students and lecturers. For example, properly
            guide a lecturer on where to place info,assignments,grades, etc, in the most accessible and efficient areas. </h2>
