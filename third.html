        <h1>Usability Test</h1>

        <h4 id="activity-text">On this page, I write about the performed usbaility taks i assigned to people. The tasks will increase in difficulty from
            the expected use of a new user, to the average general user, to an expert/advanced user. The key factor in this test is not telling the user i am testing, how 
            to perform/execute the task i assign to them.

            <h4 id="activity-text">
               First Activity: Find where my mathematics lecturer gives me assignments.

               <h1 id="user-result-text">Inexperienced User Result:</h1>

               <h4 id="activity-text"> On the first task to find the maths assignments page, the inexperienced users found the maths page very quickly under the course list.
                   However when they were on the maths page, they confused myTasks with the assignments/ assessments i had asked them to find. They tell me they have found it
                   and no tasks are due. Once i informed them that was not the assessments page, they then quickly found the page.<br>
                   On the second task to find my grades/marks for mathematics, the inexperienced users went back into the maths course page, and could not complete the task.
                   They had given up. After i reluctantly gave them a hint to go back to the home page, they quickly found the myMarks header in tools.<br>
                   For the third task which was to find the calender and set an event, i had them do the task twice from different pages. From the Home Page, the users qucikly
                   looked at tools and found the calender instantly, going in and setting the event.
                   When i had set them to the Courses Page instead of the home page, the complete opposite happened. <br>
                   First they tried to use the course search tab. Which yielded no results when they typed in calender. They then continued to stare at the screen for a minute
                   completely oblivious to the drop down bar in the top right which is a shortcut to the calender and other pages. The user then gave up, went to Home, and found
                   the page Again.
