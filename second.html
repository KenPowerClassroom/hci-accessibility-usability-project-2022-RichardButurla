        <h3>Blackboard has a consistency of color. It awlays has white,black,gray and blue colors.
            The layout of the website always looks like white board or page, ironic since it is named blackboard.(this is a heuristic too).
            The layout of a white background and boxes with blue headings is consistent. The blue color indicating you are about to travel to a more information concentrated page.</h3>
